- Title: The Developer's Daily Protocol Tags: #meta #workflow #guide
  
  Phase 1: Capture (Logseq)
  Morning: Open Logseq to the current Journal page.
  
  During Work: Log technical hurdles.
  
  Example: Fixed neural net backpropagation bug. Adjusted learning rate $\eta = 0.01$ #NavIntel
  
  Task Management: Use /TODO blocks. These can be queried across the whole vault.
  
  Phase 2: Refine (Obsidian)
  Weekly Review: Open Obsidian. Review the links created in Logseq.
  
  Synthesize: If a topic (like Avalonia UI Patterns) has multiple entries in the journal, move the best parts into a permanent note in /pages using the Text Transporter plugin.
  
  Leadership Tracking: Update the "Achievements" or "Strategy" notes for your Ericsson R&D targets based on the week's logs.
  
  Phase 3: Project Maintenance
  README Sync: When updating a project's README.md in your IDE (VS Code/Rider), the changes automatically reflect in the Wiki due to the symlink.
  
  Backup: Ensure the Git sync script runs to keep the Laptop and PC in parity.
