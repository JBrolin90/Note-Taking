- Luhmann's #[[Zettels of Zettels]] means that you use an index card to link two notes/ideas together. This sounds a bit similar to a many to many relation in a relational database. In the case of Luhmann's physical system I assume an index card is a titled card that describes the association or connection in addition to the links.
