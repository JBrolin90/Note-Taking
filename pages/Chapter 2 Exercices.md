### 2.1 Consider the [[Context Free Grammar]]

S := S S + | S S * | a

Assume S is a non-terminal and that the letter "a" is a [[token]], like number where each a may have a unique [[lexeme]]. 

a) Show how the string a a + a *  can be generated by this [[grammar]]
-  In S S *, match the first S to SS+ and and the second S to "a" , giving us S S + a + \*,   and each of the remaining S:es  to an a and we have a a + a \*
b) Construct a [[Parse Tree]] for this string
       *
      /     \ 
       \+      a 
    \/  \
    a   a

c)  This grammar generates arithmetic expressions for the binary operator addition and multiplication in post fix form.

### 2.2 What language is generated by the following grammars?
Justify answers

a) S := 0 S 1 | 0 1   (0 and one are tokens in this case)
This grammar generates one or more zeroes followed by equal numbers of ones
