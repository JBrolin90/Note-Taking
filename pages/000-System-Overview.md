- Title: System Overview: The Hybrid Developer Brain Tags: #meta #workflow #system #LogSeq #Obsidian #Tools 
  
  The Philosophy
  This system bridges the gap between log-based capturing (Logseq) and structured knowledge management (Obsidian). It is designed to support C# development (NavIntel/Avalonia), Home Automation, and Senior Leadership R&D goals.
  
  The Tools
  Logseq (The Stream): Used for daily journals, meeting notes, and rapid task capturing. It excels at "What did I do today?"
  
  Obsidian (The Garden): Used for project dashboards, business plans, and long-term technical documentation. It excels at "What do I know about X?"
  
  Git (The Spine): Version control and synchronization between the main PC and laptop (LMDE 7).
