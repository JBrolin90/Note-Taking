The [[Zettelkasten Method]], is a [[Personal Knowledge Management System]] powered by a [[Note Taking Method]]
The main idea is that each note is [[Atomic]], aka [[Modular]], or has a [[Single Responsibility]]. You tag notes to reflect their Topic with one or more tags.

### When to use the Zettelkasten method
The blog, focuses on when not to use the Zettelkasten method and states that it is not good for lectures or meeting note taking. I would contest that and instead assert that Fleeting Notes aka Inbox Notes are excellent for lecture and meeting note-taking. 
The blogger also suggest to have one Zettelkasten (box) per topic. I would challenge that as well as it would risk to isolate ideas from each other. You would use several (physical) boxes only because each box can hold a limited number notes, not to separate topics or ideas.
