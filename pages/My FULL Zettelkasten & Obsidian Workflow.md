- She does link from Media Notes and those are quite long. When reading a book, Destina takes notes from each chapter, atomic notes from each chapter.
- Only write permanent notes for things that really interests you or are relevant to what you are doing. It is important to be restrictive on what goes into your permanent notes vault.
