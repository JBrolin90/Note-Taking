- In order to initially set up any Git server, you have to export an existing repository into a new bare repository — a repository that doesn’t contain a working directory. This is generally straightforward to do. In order to clone your repository to create a new bare repository, you run the clone command with the --bare option. By convention, bare repository directory names end with the suffix .git, like so:
  ls-type:: annotation
  hl-page:: 116
  hl-color:: red
  id:: 695e9c17-398b-45da-aa36-8f1f3af65c80
